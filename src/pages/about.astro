                            Hey there! üëã Let me take you back to my school
                            days, where my journey with programming began. The
                            first language I got my hands on was Java. Truth be
                            told, it didn't click immediately, but as the fog of
                            confusion started lifting, I began to see the
                            limitless possibilities that come with programming.
                            It felt like unlocking a new level in a game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My initial projects were humble - starting with a
                            simple calculator. But you know how it goes, once
                            the ball starts rolling, there's no stopping. My
                            ambitions grew and led me to create a Mandelbrot set
                            generator before my Java class even ended. It's
                            essentially a mathematical formula that creates
                            visually captivating images, combining the beauty of
                            mathematics with art.
                        </p>

                            Let's switch gears and talk about a venture close to
                            my heart: CodeClubMG. üåü This incredible association
                            paves the way for the young tech enthusiasts,
                            opening the coding realm to kids aged 11 and up.
                            When I stumbled upon CodeClubMG, I felt an instant
                            connection. It was an opportunity to not just grow
                            as a developer but to give back, sharing my
                            learnings and projects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <i>Now, here's where the adventure kicks in:</i> My first
                            mission was to develop an iOS mobile app for CodeClubMG.
                            The catch? I had zero experience in iOS development!
                            But, never one to back down, I dived headfirst into Swift
                            and managed to build a fully functional app. That was
                            not just an achievement; it was a milestone that opened
                            doors for me within CodeClubMG.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As I integrated features into the app, I evolved
                            from being a participant to taking on the mantle of
                            a mentor, guiding developers through the mystique of
                            iOS development. üçè
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            But wait, there's more! Next on my project list was
                            spicing up the CodeClubMG website with a custom
                            coding challenges platform. I loved every moment of
                            this project, collaborating with fellow developers
                            and enriching my web development skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My last project at CodeClubMG was contributing to
                            the reconstruction and redesign of their learning
                            platform. This revamp was particularly crucial
                            during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it provided a
                            simple way for teachers to interact with their
                            students remotely. üñ•Ô∏è
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through these projects, not only did I grow as a
                            developer but also realized the sheer joy in
                            fostering a nurturing environment for the next
                            generation of coders.

                        <p>
                            Now, let's talk about the cherry on top. üçí As a
                            testament to the effort and dedication I poured into
                            these projects, I was presented with an exciting
                            opportunity. I was offered a paid position as a web

                            This was a turning point in my journey. Stepping
                            into the professional world with a company was the
                            kind of validation that all those late nights and
                            endless lines of code were building towards. It was
                            an affirmation that when passion meets perseverance,
                            remarkable things happen. üöÄ

                            At imat-uve, I'm thrilled to be part of a dynamic
                            team that's crafting an ERP system aimed at
                            innovating and transforming automotive validation
                            processes. Essentially, we're building tech that
                            makes automotive material testing smarter and more
                            efficient.

                            My role is pretty diverse; I get to work on both the
                            frontend and backend of the application. Plus, I'm
                            one who keeps an eye on the existing features,
                            ensuring they're running smoothly and are updated to
                            keep pace with changing needs. A key focus is
                            ensuring the system is future-proof allowing for
                            scalability and growth. üí™

                            One of the cool parts of being on this team is how
                            much I've learned. We work using agile methodologies
                            like Scrum which taught me a ton about effective
                            teamwork. I've also learned how to build large-scale
                            applications and how to write code that's clean and
                            easy to work with.

                            learning, and growing. And it feels great to be part
                            of something big that can make a difference in the

                            When school days came to an end, I decided to hit
                            the pause button before jumping into the next big
                            thing. I took a gap year - but, oh boy, it was
                            anything but a break! I set out to sharpen my
                            skills, dive into personal projects, and basically
                            become a web development ninja. ü•ã

                        <p>
                            During this time, I worked on an array of projects.
                            One that's particularly dear to me is the revamped
                            version of my Mandelbrot set explorer (remember, the
                            cool math-to-art one?). This time, I used Angular
                            and gave it a superpower with WebGL (thanks to
                            three.js) for rendering. The result? A whopping
                            1000x speed boost, making it a real-time explorer.

                        <p>
                            But wait, my coding marathon didn't stop there. I
                            built a custom markdown CMS, a music streaming bot
                            for Discord, and a chatbot with a dash of AI magic
                            from GPT-3. The rhythm game enthusiasts were not
                            forgotten - I crafted web apps, Chrome extensions,
                            and Twitch extensions centered around Beat Saber,
                            the popular VR rhythm game.

                            Of course, you can't sharpen your skills without
                            some knowledge infusion. I enrolled in courses like
                            "CS50: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with
                            Python" and "CS50: Introduction to Computer Science"
                            from HarvardX. I also cracked open the mysteries of
                            CSS with Kevin Powell's "CSS Demystified" and
                            refined my design prowess with Supercharge's
                            "Advanced Figma Course".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            And cherry on top - I earned the "Professional Scrum
                            Master I" and "Professional Scrum Product Owner I"
                            certifications from Scrum.org. üìú

                            and building. Curious to see what I've been up to?

                            Now, let's talk about my quest for higher education.
                            I initially set sail at Heinrich Heine University in
                            D√ºsseldorf, pursuing a computer science bachelor's
                            degree. However, I quickly realized my heart yearned
                            for something more practical, something that would
                            let me dive hands-on into the world of web
                            development.

                        <p>
                            So, I made a switch! I moved to IU International
                            University of Applied Sciences and enrolled in the
                            bachelor's program for media computer science. This
                            was the perfect match! It's super hands-on, web
                            development-centric, and gives me that ‚ÄúAha! This is
                            actually useful!‚Äù feeling when I learn. I'm
                            currently in the 4th semester out of 6, and let me
                            tell you, it's been quite the ride.
